## About

**minishell** is a project aimed at creating a simple shell in C. The project is designed to help students understand how command-line interpreters work, focusing on parsing, executing commands, handling signals, and managing processes.

## How It Works

The minishell project involves implementing a command-line interpreter that can execute built-in commands as well as external programs. It handles command parsing, redirection, pipelines, and supports basic shell features like signal handling and environment variable management.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., gcc)
- Make

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/karimomino/minishell.git
